Once you have the application running, follow these steps to use the collaborative editing feature:

1. **Log in to the Django Admin**: Use your admin credentials to log in.
2. **Navigate to a Model**: Choose a model you want to edit.
3. **Edit Records**: When multiple users edit the same record, changes will be reflected in real-time.

You can check the presence indicators to see who else is editing the same record.

## Configuration

You can customize the behavior of the Django Admin Collaborator through the settings. Here are some key configurations:

- **WebSocket URL**: Specify the WebSocket URL for your application.

### Example Configuration

In your `settings.py`, add the following:

```python
# WebSocket configuration
WEBSOCKET_URL = 'ws://localhost:8000/ws/admin/'

# Redis configuration
REDIS_URL = 'redis://localhost:6379/0'

# Lock duration in seconds
LOCK_DURATION = 300
```
